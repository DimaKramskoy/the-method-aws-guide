## About "Righting Software"

This guideline is based on **"Righting Software"** by Juval Löwy, published by Addison-Wesley Professional in 2019.

**Full Citation**: Löwy, Juval. _Righting Software_. Boston: Addison-Wesley Professional, 2019.

## The Method

**The Method** is a structured engineering approach to system and project design introduced by Juval Löwy. It provides systematic techniques for:

- Volatility-based decomposition
- Component taxonomy and classification
- Layered architecture design
- Project design and estimation

## Our Contribution

All core architectural principles, component taxonomy, and design concepts are attributed to Juval Löwy and his work in "Righting Software."

This project's contribution is demonstrating how these proven principles naturally apply to AWS cloud services, specifically:

- Mapping The Method's component types to AWS serverless services
- Showing how volatility-based decomposition works in cloud-native architectures
- Providing concrete examples of The Method applied to AWS
- Creating reference implementations using AWS CDK and TypeScript

## Acknowledgments

We are grateful to Juval Löwy for developing The Method and sharing these principles with the software engineering community. His work has provided a rigorous foundation for system design that remains highly relevant in the cloud era.
